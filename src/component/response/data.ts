We are looking for a developer who will lead the team and who feels strongly not only about building good software but also about running that software in the real world.\n\nAmazon in a fast-paced environment where we “Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History.” On a typical day, software engineers might whip up a prototype to prove an idea, instrument code to report a new metric, talk with customers, code up a feature, or draft a proposal for a radical new idea.\n\nWe are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:\n\nArlington, VA\n\nHerndon, VA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nA day in the life\n\nAbout The Team\n\nDiverse Experiences\n\nAWS values diverse experiences.

Then this position might be the right fit for you! Azure is Microsoft’s central cloud infrastructure hosting both our... public cloud offerings as well as a vast number of Microsoft-internal cloud scale services. Cloud computing is a rapidly growing market, and it is Azure’s aim to be an industry leader in all relevant aspects and dimensions across its platform and services. Within Azure, the Azure Compute team is the core infrastructure team responsible for hosting VMs, containers, and other workloads.\n\nOne of the fundamental core disciplines in cloud computing is capacity management. Capacity management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demands, while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other. The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Compute tasked with managing all aspects of capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Our primary task is to provide a fully automated and highly optimized tracking and management system. This system – of which CMAS (Capacity Management Automation System) is a core piece – uses numerous state-of-the-art algorithms. We use artificial intelligence to automatically predict capacity risk and execute the correct mitigation actions directly into the Azure Compute platform.\n\nAs a Software Design Engineer, the value of your work will be reflected as improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. Our team is a balanced team of data science and development engineers, and we work very closely with our partners in the program management team. We heavily engage in using state-of-the-art data science/applied statistical techniques like anomaly detection, machine learning, and experimentation methodologies, and if you are interested in such techniques and their applications to highly complex real-world problems, you will fit right into our team. Collectively, we deliver world-class innovation.\n\nMicrosoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

These requirements include, but are not limited to the following specialized security screenings:\n• Microsoft Cloud Background Check: This position will be required to pass the Microsoft Cloud background check upon hire/transfer and every two years thereafter.\n\nAdditional / Preferred Qualifications\n• Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science\n• OR related technical field AND 2+ years technical engineering experience with any of the following: C#, Python, JAVA, C++, and proficiency with relational databases esp. related to data technologies (SQL, Kusto, etc.)\n• OR equivalent experience.\n• Hands-on industry experience working on cloud or cloud infrastructure-related problems is a big plus.\n\nSoftware Engineering IC2 - The typical base pay range for this role across the U.S. is USD $76,400 - $151,800 per year.
